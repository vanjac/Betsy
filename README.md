# Betsy

Betsy is a chatbot written in Java. It:
- Can remember facts
- Can answer questions using facts you have told it
- Has a basic knowledge of itself
- Can follow (or choose to ignore) simple commands
- Knows what you mean when you say “he,” “she,” “it,” “them,” etc.

Betsy isn't very interesting to talk to, has very bad grammar and often doesn't know what you're talking about.
But it can still be entertaining sometimes.
